=begin
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. 
For example, the string aabccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. 
If the compressed string is smaller than the original string, your method should return the compressed string. 
You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).
